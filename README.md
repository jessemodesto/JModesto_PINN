# JModesto_PINN

This library is utilzed to create PINNs (Physics Informed Nueral Networks) by providing a high level approach to function and datasets creation. One can define constants, training datasets, test datasets, a collocation points function,a boundary conditions function, a physical model (to check test error) function, and behavior for full and batch loss functions.
